# SnakeGame

TODO LIST:
- Deciding between giving up on the tile system and moving to a smoother tick system.
    - an inbetween could be to render twice as much, except one of the renders simply draws half way and takes no calculations
 
- adding a gameboard changer menu
- adding the computer AI player for two player modes
      - coding the AI for two player.
      
- Bug fixes and all that stuff.
